2010 Adobe Placement Paper:-

1. How does free() function work ?

2. Expand a[3][2][5]=6;

3. **foo(int rows, int columns) – asked to allocate a memory dynamically for a 2-Dimensional array and return that pointer from function foo?

4. Int main()
{
int a[4]={10,23,24,65};
int *prt=a;
int index
for(index=0;index<4;index++)
{
printf(“%d”,*prt);
Ptr+=sizeof(int);
}
}

5. Find the depth of a binary tree?

6. How Generic Swap of two elements can be implemented? that supports all type line int char float double etc..

7. Number of times multiplication is required:

int computeXn(int x int n)
{
if(n%2=0)
{
return x*x;
}
else if(n%2=0)
{
int y computeXn(x n/2);
return y*y;
}
else if(n%2=1)
{
int y computeXn(x n/2);
return y*y*x;
}
}
Calculating power of a tree for 5^12.

8. Find the path from root to all the leaf nodes?

9. How do you sort a huge data such that all of the data at a time cant fit into the main memory? Write the pseudo code for it?

10. Head(aann)=a Tail(aann)=ann cont(aa,bb)=aabb; For which of the following : cont(head(s),head(tail(tail(s)))='ac'

i. aaac
ii. abbc
iii. accc
iv. Abdc

11. You have two threads T1 and T2 they are reader and writer respectively. Implement the reader, writer problem using the following functions?
With some specification:
ADDNEW.Process
PROCESS.SET
PROCESS.RESET
ENTER CS
EXIT CS
LOOP
EXIT LOOP
WAIT# PROCESS

12. a 3-d matrix was given in format a[3][2][4]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24} find **(*a+1)

13. a assembly code was given ... it was too ajeeb sa ..i cud not get that

14. which is the best data structure to check correct paranthesization of an expression ?? give reasons ?

15. Binary search Tree was given. Find 4th smallest element.

16. Some code in assembly was given and given five options. What is being calculated?

Ans (XY) 2 + Y + Z

17. Represent (-5)10 in 2’s complement representation in 8 bits

18. Expression was given. Draw tree and then find the postfix

19. Some commands in the assembly language were given. Then need to convert this code in assembly

A=300;
For (i=0 ; i&lt;=10 ;  i++)
A=A+200;
